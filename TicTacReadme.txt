My TicTacWhoa game has 4 options: human v. human game, human v. AI game, game settings, and exit. The human v. human game takes input from two users to player the game. In the human v. AI game the user can choose to go before or after the AI. In the game settings, the user can change the color and characters for player 1 and player 2.

Overall, I think my implementation of the game went well. However, my code is fairly long and not very efficient; many sections of code are repeated throughout my program.
